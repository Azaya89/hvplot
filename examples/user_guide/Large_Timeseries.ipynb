Nearly all of these approaches will work well for small datasets, but choosing an appropriate method is crucial for being able to work naturally with larger datasets of different types and for different goals. Examples are shown using hvPlot syntax, but the results would be similar in HoloViews and (for the simplest cases) pure Bokeh syntax.\n",

Bokeh also supports WebGL rendering that uses your machine's graphic card GPU, but until mid-2023 Bokeh's WebGL support was incomplete and so it was not typically used in HoloViews. Here, we are using newer versions of Bokeh, HoloViews, and hvPlot, where WebGL is enabled by default, but we can explicitly disable it to see the previous supported approach:"

Thus Datashader will send only a fixed amount of data (the rendered plot), potentially greatly speeding up plots of the largest datasets. As for LTTB, plots will only be updated after a zoom or pan if Python is still running, because Python is what renders and supplies the updated image.
