    "Effectively representing temporal dynamics in large datasets requires selecting appropriate visualization techniques that ensure responsiveness while providing both a macroscopic view of overall trends and a microscopic view of fine details. This guide will explore various methods, such as WebGL Rendering, LTTB Downsampling, Datashader, and Minimap, each suited for different aspects of large timeseries data visualization. We predominantly demonstrate the use of hvPlot syntax, leveraging HoloViews for more complex requirements. Although hvPlot supports multiple backends, including Matplotlib and Plotly, our focus will be on Bokeh due to its advanced capabilities in handling large timeseries data.\n",

    "Rendering in hvPlot and HoloViews for Bokeh plots has evolved significantly. Prior to HoloViews version 1.16.0 (May 2023), Bokeh's custom HTML **Canvas** rendering was the default. This approach works well for datasets up to a few tens of thousands of points but struggles above 100K points, particularly in terms of zooming and panning speed. Now, if you want to utilize Canvas rendering, set `hv.renderer(\"bokeh\").webgl = False` prior to creating your hvPlot object.\n",
    "\n",
    "Around mid-2023, the adoption of improved **WebGL** as the default for hvPlot and HoloViews allowed for smoother interactions with larger datasets by utilizing GPU-acceleration. It's important to note that WebGL performance can vary based on your machine's specifications. For example, some Mac models may not exhibit a marked improvement in WebGL performance over Canvas due to GPU specifications."

Especially if your code is running on a remote server, transferring that data can be very slow, and updating it on pan and zoom can take a long time even with WebGL for larger datasets.

[Datashader](https://datashader.org) works in a different way, rendering the data into a frame buffer on the server, and then sending that buffer to the web browser rather than the individual data points. Thus Datashader will send only a fixed amount of data (the rendered plot), potentially greatly speeding up plots of the largest datasets. As for LTTB, plots will only be updated after a zoom or pan if Python is still running, because Python is what renders and supplies the updated image. Setting the argument `line_width` to a value above 0 will enable [anti-aliasing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-aliasing) of the line. "
